# Aamon's Dmenu config

Here is my dmenu config.

Here are the commands to setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDmenu.git
cd AamonDmenu # or whatever you called the directory
./install.sh {theme} # use the "-cli" option if you are installing from a TTY
```

Dmenu can then be run using "dmenu_run" or any other dmenu command.

You must have `libxft-bgra` installed until the libxft upstream is fixed.
